# Michelle Pruitt — Power Platform & Automation Portfolio

Senior Consultant specializing in enterprise Microsoft Power Platform solutions (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Dataverse) with experience delivering in both commercial and regulated environments (including GCC High).

This repository contains **sanitized, portfolio-safe** examples: case studies, architecture diagrams, and reusable patterns.  
**No client data, secrets, tenant identifiers, or proprietary documentation** are included.

## What you’ll find here

- **Case studies** with problem → constraints → architecture → engineering decisions → results
- **Architecture diagrams** showing system design and integration boundaries
- **Reusable patterns** (Power Fx / DAX / flow patterns) that demonstrate engineering approach

---

## Featured Case Studies

### 1) Enterprise Request Intake & Approval Platform (Commercial)
**Power Apps (Canvas) + Dataverse + Power Automate + Power BI**

Highlights:
- Structured intake and approval workflow
- Performance-tuned Canvas app patterns
- Power BI dashboard for **backlog trend tracking** and **executive reporting**
